# I like python as it is a straightforward language. There are different libraries with tonnes of functionalities for databases, UI, Maths, Graphics, analysis and more. Through my projects, I try to implement the knowledge I possess and learn while at it.
# This repository contains all of my projects in Python and I hope it can be easy to understand incase you refer them.
